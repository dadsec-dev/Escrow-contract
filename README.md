# An Escrow contract 

_Basically this Escrow is just a random contract i am building for an Imaginery company that accepts crypto token from it's customers and deliver products or services off-chain._


## How It Works:
**Pay:** Users / customers deposits a certain amount of an ERC20 token; usdt, busd or the company's native token.

**Services Delivered:** If deposit was succesful, the company will process and deliver the service offchain.

**Refund Policies:** Incase of errors or problems, the company can refund the customer.


## Extra Features i'll be working on;
**Meta-transaction:** I will be implementing meta-transactions so that customers to this platforms will not have to pay gass fees, basically gasless transactions on every function call.

**Onchain verification:** On-chain signature verification (BONUS STUFF).
